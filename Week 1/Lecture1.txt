The goal is to not learn a specific language through this class, but instead that you've learned how to program.
> unfortunately with a more traditional language, there's more distraction.

Human language is more complex and involves more syntax than computer language.
  However
Computer language requires you to be more precise.  Code ultimately needs to be correct (which goes without saying).

It's hard to become comfortable with the DESIGN of your code.

Integrated Develop Environments (IDEs): aka text editors.
> these are tools that programmers use to write code (VS Code).

GUI: Graphical User Interface (basically the left side bar of VS code)

CLI: Command Line Interface (terminal) this is what we will mostly be dealing with.
  $ make *filename* = compiling.  You have to do this before the output will be correct.  Compiling is the process of taking in source code and putting out machine code (binary).
  $ ./file (this pulls up any file in your current folder)
  $ rm = remove file (this removes the file named 'file')
  $ ls = list (this lists all the files in your current folder, if you never want to use GUI)
